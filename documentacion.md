#Background
<p>I chose this theme because I do not always have the time to feed myself properly so I turn to supplements to have all the nutrients I need and I thought it was good to be able to get some supplements to other people who have the same situation as me.</p>


#Wire Frame
<p>My wire frame my wire frame is located in the images folder with the main page name and suplements pages.</p>
<p>I only have two photos because the suplements pages have all the same design.</p>


#Color Choices
<p>I chose the color yellow because this color has the indicative of life and since the site is about supplements and the importance of them to have a better life I think it's all about and I chose the lighter yellow because I was looking for one more color and I thought it made a good contrast.</p>


#Accessibility
<p>In accessibility I have the alternative text for images and it is possible to navigate the site with the keyboard.</p>


#GDPR
<p>I created the privaty and policy for my website.</p>


#Distance Selling
<p>I donÂ´t have take any measure for the the online and distance selling act.</p>


#Evaluation
<p>I think I was able to solve the problem that I chose to solve, since I showed some supplements that we should all take to improve our day to day.
During the creation of the site I had problems with the javascript of the read more because it was bugging and not working.
I just tested my website on the computer.
I wanted to have a simple website and easy navigation, and some of my inspiration came from the tca that we had done before.</p>
